# Deepfake Detection System 
An AI-powered Deepfake Detection System using CNNs, TensorFlow, Flask, and OpenCV to classify real vs. fake images for cybersecurity and misinformation prevention.

# Project Overview
This project detects AI-generated deepfake images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of real and fake images to improve media authenticity verification. A Flask-based web application is integrated to allow users to upload images and get real-time deepfake detection results.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Flask, Matplotlib
Model: Custom CNN architecture with BatchNormalization, Dropout, and LeakyReLU
Optimization: Adam Optimizer, Hyperparameter Tuning
Web Framework: Flask for real-time deepfake detection

# Features
1. Detects real vs. fake images with high accuracy.
2. Trained on a deepfake dataset for improved classification.
3. Flask web interface for easy user interaction.
4. Supports real-time image uploads for inference.

# Future Improvements
1. Improve model accuracy with Transfer Learning
